Normally starting a project with a group in University means a lot of wrangling cats, getting everyone on the same page and making appointments with everyone.
Luckily in this case, I'm working with known quantities, I know my team, and I know their strengths.  We started by briefly going over what the expectations were to make sure we were on the same page.
I started by making an appointment at the library to get a group room after a class we all have together.  When we arrived, it turned out Dom had already drawn out the ERD and it just needed a little refinment.  I drew it out on a whiteboard so we could discuss it, and Nicole immediately started going over the organization of the information and discussing the real world implications of keeping the data, what would be expected if she were actually using a system like this to keep track of buildings.  There was a lot of discussion about the ERD between Dom, nicole and I, working to make sure that the information we were including would meet the requirements of the project.  After we had worked on the ERD, we noticed Diesel hadn't really chipped in too much, just a bit about the relationships and data we were including.  When we asked him, he said he had already completed some of the queries and was waiting for us to finalize the attributes.  He had found that we were doing good work, and just started on the next task.  For someone like me, this is the perfect team, I can bring everyone together, help smooth out some wrinkles and just let them loose to get the things done.
